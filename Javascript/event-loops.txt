V8 engine has
	1) Call stack
	2) Memory Heap

JS is a single threaded programming language.
Means it has a single call stack -> it can do one thing at a time.

Call stack basically is a data structure that records where in the program we are

<code>

function foo(){        |
	return foo();      |
}                      | Error :  Maximum call stack exceeded!
                       |
foo();                 |
