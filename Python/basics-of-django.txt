Install python >> python --version
then virtual environment > pip install virtualenv

once virtual env is installed, go to the project folder and run 
virtualenv venv >> this command is to create a virtual environment >> here name is venv

another eg: virtualenv vipinenvironment

once virtualenv is created, lets activate it
venv\Scripts\activate >> where venv is the virtual environment

to deactivate the venv, run >>  source venv\Scripts\deactivate.bat

inside the venv, we install Django 
pip install django

once we install django, create a new project by running the command
django-admin startproject myproject

See the django app folder below

myproject/                  <-- higher level folder
 |-- myproject/             <-- django project folder
 |    |-- myproject/
 |    |    |-- __init__.py
 |    |    |-- settings.py
 |    |    |-- urls.py
 |    |    |-- wsgi.py
 |    +-- manage.py
 +-- venv/                  <-- virtual environment folder


 explanation
 ------------------
 manage.py >> is a shortcut to the django-admin command line utility
 __init__.py >> an empty file which tells python that this folder is a python package
 settings.py >> all of the project's configuration
 urls.py >> deals with the routing of the appplication
 wsgi.py >> simply a gateway interface of deployment ( we dont need to worry about this at this point of time! )

 once we reach our virtual env folder, to run the django we just installed, run the command
 >> python manage.py runserver
